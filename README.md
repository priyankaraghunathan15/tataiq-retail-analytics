# TATA Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

This project was completed as part of the **Tata Insights and Quants (Tata iQ) Virtual Experience Programme**, which simulates real-world data storytelling scenarios faced by professionals in analytics and business intelligence. The experience focused on solving executive-level business problems using data visualization and culminated in a final presentation to company leadership.

I applied **Tableau** to explore, analyze, and visualize sales and customer data for an online retail store, generating strategic insights for both the **CEO** and **CMO**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The retail business wanted to evaluate key performance drivers and identify high-potential areas for strategic expansion. As the data analyst, I was tasked with:

- Cleaning and analyzing raw transaction data  
- Framing relevant questions from both operational and marketing perspectives  
- Designing targeted, intuitive visualizations in Tableau  
- Presenting business-critical insights in a structured executive summary  

This experience not only sharpened my technical and analytical thinking but also strengthened my ability to present findings in a compelling and decision-oriented format.

## ðŸ§  Project Tasks

### Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario
I developed eight stakeholder-specific questions,four for the CEO and four for the CMO based on the businessâ€™s expansion and revenue goals. These questions covered:

- Seasonal revenue fluctuations  
- Top-performing countries and customer segments  
- High-value customers  
- Geographic demand trends  

The framing ensured that all subsequent analysis aligned directly with leadership priorities.

---

### Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals
Mapped each business question to a carefully selected Tableau visual type:

- **Line Chart** â€“ Seasonal revenue trends for forecasting  
- **Stacked Bar Chart** â€“ Country-wise product revenue breakdown  
- **Box Plot** â€“ Revenue distribution by country  
- **Column Chart** â€“ Top customers by revenue contribution  
- **Map Chart** â€“ Geographic distribution of product demand  

Each visual was selected based on its ability to simplify complex patterns and support executive decision-making.

### Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals
Using Tableau, I transformed raw transactional data into clean, purpose-built dashboards. Key steps included:

- Removing negative quantities and zero-price entries  
- Filtering for complete customer records  
- Deriving key metrics like total revenue and quantity sold  
- Structuring dashboards to reflect business questions directly  

Visuals were designed with clarity, insight delivery, and stakeholder priorities in mind.

### Task 4: Communicating Insights
To conclude, I delivered a five-minute executive briefing simulating a presentation to the CEO and CMO. The script emphasized:

- **Monthly Revenue Trends** â€“ A Q4 spike indicating seasonal sales opportunities  
- **Top Countries by Revenue and Units Sold** â€“ Netherlands and Germany as high-potential markets  
- **Top Customers** â€“ A small group contributing disproportionately to total revenue, indicating loyalty program potential  
- **Demand by Country** â€“ Australia and Japan showing high product demand, useful for geographic expansion planning  

> ðŸ“„ A video presentation and script were created to summarize the analysis and recommendations clearly and persuasively.
